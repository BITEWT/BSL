  <h1>GRAPHIC  </h1>

     <p>Graphic design is also closely related to emotional design, 
    as designers must consider the emotions, expectations and
    beliefs of the viewer when creating images. This is where 
    color theory comes into play, as the chosen color palette 
    not only conveys certain messages to the viewer, but also 
    influences their emotional response to the design. For example, 
    red is a color often seen as a symbol of danger or alarm, 
    while blue is associated with the sea and sky and 
    therefore encourages a calmer response. </p>

  <h1>DESIGN  </h1>

 <p> Graphic design plays an important role in the way consumers interact with, 
    perceive and experience your brand. Therefore, it is important that you not 
    only understand the practice but also implement it in your company. Additionally, 
    the elements and principles of graphic design are applied to 
    communicate specific messages, establish brand identity, attract target audiences, 
    and improve user experience. 
    All of this is necessary for your business to not only survive, but thrive. </p>

  <h1> LOGO </h1>

 <p> Your logo differentiates your company from its competitors and is the most 
    important design element that represents your brand. It is often the
     first thing a target customer sees regarding your business and 
     therefore has the opportunity to make a good first impression and 
     convince them to do business with you. While typography plays a 
     crucial role in the success of your logo, the color palette also
     plays a crucial role. Graphic design uses color theory to ensure 
     that your logo's color palette conveys the right message to the right audience and
     evokes the emotions you want them to feel when interacting with your brand.</p>
